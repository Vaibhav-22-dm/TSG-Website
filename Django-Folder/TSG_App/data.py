about = {"about":"The department came into existence in 1965 as the Department of Aeronautical Engineering and renamed as the Department of Aerospace Engineering in 1988. Since its inception the department is engaged in imparting education in various aspects of aircraft and space technology. It offers B.Tech, Dual degree and M. Tech programmes in Aerospace Engineering. In addition, research programes lead to MS, joint M. Tech-PhD and PhD degrees also exists. At the present(2015), the faculty strength is 19. The department has 243 UG (including Dual Degree), 50 M. Tech, and 40 PhD scholars. The Department has well-equipped laboratories in the areas of Aerodynamics, Structures, Propulsion, System and Control, Intelligent Systems, Aeromodelling, Computational Fluid Dynamics and Computational Structure Mechanics. The department also has excellent computational laboratories equipped with high performance computational facilities. It also offers adequate facilities to the students to design build and fly remotely controlled/auto-controlled model aircraft including UAVs and MAVs. The department has the unique distinction of having centre of excellence in composites and Computational fluid dynamics and undertaking a large number of sponsored R & D projects and consultancies in different areas of Aerospace Engineering. It is currently running several sponsored research projects from different sponsoring agencies such as Aeronautics R & D Board, DRDO, DRDL, DST, ADA, ISRO, Indian Railway, HAL and others. Several major initiatives to meet the current demand of quality research have been taken. Firstly the department has identified five major Thrust Areas of Research namely Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and related Technologies, Smart and Composite Structures, Experimental and Computational Research on Turbulent Flows, Propulsion & Combustion and Flight Dynamics & Control. Secondly, the department has identified top 10 Journals in Aerospace Engineering and interdisciplinary areas and top 10 academic conferences around the world where the faculty and students are encouraged to publish their research works."}
